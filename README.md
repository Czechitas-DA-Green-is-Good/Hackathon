###  Prediction summary

The document describes the historical and expected future demand for natural gas in the Czech Republic. It notes that household and production sectors are the primary consumers, with uses spanning from industry, services, agriculture, transportation, electricity production, to heating. 

A significant factor affecting consumption is the replacement of coal used for heating in households with natural gas, along with similar trends in industry and district heating, and the use of gas for electricity production or mobility in the form of CNG or LNG vehicles.

According to the document, gas consumption in the 1990s grew due to gasification, peaking in 2001 at 124% of the 1995 consumption level. Since 2002, consumption has either fallen or remained constant under normal climatic conditions, due to savings (mainly in household consumption), transitions to other fuels, or increases in average outdoor temperatures.

The trend changed in 2015, when consumption started to rise again due to economic recovery (with a noticeable impact in the production sector) and the commissioning of the Počerady gas power plant (in 2013). In 2019, consumption rose to 118%.

The document also examines the factors influencing the demand for natural gas, including the role of natural gas in replacing coal in district heating and the production sector, and potential developments in the use of natural gas for electricity production and heating in households.

The document predicts that the overall demand for natural gas in the Czech Republic will rise until 2040, reaching a level of 130 TWh, primarily due to a shift away from coal use in industry and district heating, and an increase in gas consumption for mono-production of electricity. From 2040 onwards, a slight decrease or stagnation is expected in all segments, mainly due to energy savings in the industry and household segments.
